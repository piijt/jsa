    <h4>The Rules for the Game of Life</h4><br></center>
      <ul>
        <li>The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.</li><br>
        <li>1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
        <li>2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
        <li>3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
        <li>4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
      </ul>
